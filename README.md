This is a code to 
1. Generate mat2vec compostion-based features of lithium-containing solids
2. Train various machine-learning models to predict the temperature-dependant ionic conductivity of lithium using the features
3. Compare the performance of vaious machine learning models
4. Predict the ionic conductivity of the test set with the best-trained model
5. Screen the Materials Project database for compounds with high Li-ion conductivity with the traied model

It is advised to run Test_predictions.ipynb after running mat2vec_fv.ipynb
